# Linear-Regression-one-variable-
 Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering diﬀerent cities for opening a new outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for proﬁts and populations from the cities.
The ﬁle ex1data1.txt contains the dataset for our linear regression problem. The ﬁrst column is the population of a city and the second column is the proﬁt of a food truck in that city. A negative value for proﬁt indicates a loss.
